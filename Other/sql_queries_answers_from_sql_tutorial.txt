My solutions on prictice with https://sql-ex.ru/  

1)
SELECT 
    model, speed, hd
FROM PC
WHERE price < 500

2)
SELECT 
    DISTINCT     
    maker
FROM Product
WHERE type = 'Printer'

3)
SELECT 
    model,
    ram,
    screen
FROM Laptop
WHERE price > 1000

4)
SELECT 
    *
FROM Printer 
WHERE color = 'y'

5)
SELECT 
    model,
    speed,
    hd
FROM PC 
WHERE (cd = '12x' OR cd = '24x') AND price < 600

6)
SELECT 
    DISTINCT Product.maker,
    Laptop.speed
FROM
    Laptop
INNER JOIN
    Product 
ON
    Laptop.model = Product.model
WHERE
    Laptop.hd >= 10
	
7)
SELECT 
	res.model,
	price
FROM 
	(SELECT model, price
	FROM PC
	UNION
	SELECT model, price
	FROM Laptop
	UNION
	SELECT model, price
	FROM Printer) AS res
WHERE res.model 
IN (SELECT model FROM Product WHERE maker = 'B')

8)
SELECT
   maker
FROM
   Product
WHERE type = 'PC' 
EXCEPT
SELECT
   maker
FROM
   Product
WHERE type = 'Laptop'


9) Find all makers which produce PC with CPU speed at least 450 MHz.
SELECT
    DISTINCT maker AS Maker
FROM
    Product
RIGHT JOIN
    PC 
ON Product.model = PC.model
WHERE 
    PC.speed >= 450
	
	
10) Find all printer models with the highest price.
SELECT 
    model,
    price
FROM 
    Printer
WHERE
    price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM Printer)

11)
SELECT 
    AVG(speed) AS average_speed
FROM PC

12)
SELECT 
    AVG(speed) AS laptop_average_speed
FROM Laptop
WHERE price > 1000

13)
SELECT
    AVG(speed) AS average_pc_speed
FROM 
    PC
JOIN 
(SELECT * FROM Product WHERE maker = 'A') AS Makers
ON PC.model = Makers.model
